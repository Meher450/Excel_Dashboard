# 📊 Indian Ports & Fleet Performance Dashboard

A professional and interactive Excel-based dashboard analyzing the performance of Indian ports and fleet over time. This project focuses on delivering actionable insights into cargo trends, fleet growth, port productivity, and turnaround time using clean data visualization and pivot-based reporting.

---

## 🧭 Project Overview

This project provides a visual and analytical summary of India’s maritime operations using official data from the Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Waterways and the Indian Ports Association. It includes year-wise cargo trends, regional comparisons, fleet distribution by age, and operational metrics like berth output and turnaround time.

The dashboard is designed to be interactive, user-friendly, and informative for policymakers, students, logistics professionals, and researchers.
